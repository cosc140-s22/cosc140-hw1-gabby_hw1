      <h3><a name="folklore">Welsh Folklore and Culture</a></h3>
      <section>
        In Welsh Folklore and Culture, we read old Welsh stories and... believe it or not... folklore tales. We learn about important Welsh symbols (like the leek, daffodil, red dragon) and where those symbols even originated from. 

        So far we have learned about: 
        <ul>
          <div class="bold"><li>Lovespoons:</div> These were given by young men as love tokens for a wedding gift. This symbolizes how the spoon was a show of the man's craftmanship but would last a lifetime in the young couple's new home.
          <div class="bold"><li>Leek:</div> The leek acknowledges the bravery of archers. The story goes that Saint David told soldiers to wear a leek so the other members of the army would be able to recognize their countrymen. 
          <div class="bold"><li>Daffodil:</div> The daffodil became a symbol of Wales when the only Prime Minister from Wales decided to wear a daffodil instead of a leek on Saint David's day because "it smelled nicer". 
          <div class="bold"><li>Red Dragon:</div> The red dragon is a symbol from a story often, but not always, related to Merlin. A king wanted to build a church on a hill, but everytime he begun, the next day and progress would be leveled. A young Merlin informed the king that everynight, the disturbed ground would release two dragons - a white one and a red one. The white one would appear to win, until the very end where the red one was able to hold his ground. The white dragon symbolizes the Saxons trying to conquer Wales and the red dragon is Wales managing to hold out for as long as needed.
        </ul>

      <h3><a name="literature">Welsh Literature</a></h3>
      <section>
        In this class, we read works by Welsh writers. We have already read Kate Roberts' works where the focus is often on the working class and struggles they face. Many of the works we will be reading were originally written in Welsh, which brings about the question of translation and how well you can understand an author's point after their work has been translated.

        Congrats, now you know the basics of speaking Welsh. It's hard to communicate pronounciation across text, but there are plenty of good YouTube videos that have native-speakers and teachers helping you learn more!
